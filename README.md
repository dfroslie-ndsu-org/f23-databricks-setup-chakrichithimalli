# Databricks Setup Assignment

This assignment walks you through the set up of a Databrick instance and connection to your storage account.  Assignment steps:
- Follow DataBricksSetup.pdf to set up the resource and security links to the storage account.
-- Note:  It will be easiest to reuse your Assignment 1 storage account as the data file is the same.  If needed, the data file is also in the InputData folder of this repo.
- Follow GithubIntegrationToDatabricks.pdf to connect to your Github account and clone the assignment repo in Databricks.
- Follow the steps in SetupAssignment.py to manipulate the data.
    - Commit your changes and push the repo when done.
- Outside of Databricks where you originally cloned this repo, pull the changes from Databricks to avoid conflicts later.
- Go to your storage account in the Azure portal.
    - Take screenshots of the saved CSV files and save to the AssignmentEvidence folder.
    - Download the 'Range' file, rename it to 'SandP500Daily_Range.csv', and save to the AssignmentEvidence folder
    - Download the 'PercentChange' file, rename it to 'SandP500Daily_PercentChange.csv', and save to the AssignmentEvidence folder.
- Commit and push your submission.
